# Digital Operational Resilience Act

What is DORA? If you are a software engineer you have a very different understanding of it. This is not the DevOps Research and Assessment. This is a new regulation in the European Union that enforces a comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for all EU financial entities. 

This is a space for my own understanding of the regulation and how to tackle it. This is a work in progress and you will find things missing. If you are an expert feel free to contribute to the project.
